# Firewall Controller

This controller is installed on a bare-metal firewall in front of several kubernetes worker nodes and responsible to reconcile a `ClusterwideNetworkPolicy` to nftables rules to control access to and from the kubernetes cluster.
It allows also to control the traffic rate going through, to limit network resources for restricted usage scenarios. Nftable and node metrics are exposed with the `nftables-exporter` and `node-exporter`, the ips are visible as service and endpoint from the kubernetes cluster.

Additional an IDS is managed on the firewall to detect known network anomalies. [suricata](https://suricata-ids.org) is used for this purpose. Right now, only basic statistics about the amount of scanned packets is reported. In a future release, access to all alarms will be provided.

## Architecture

![Architecture](architecture.svg)

## Automatically generated ingress rules

For every `Service` of type `LoadBalancer` in the cluster, the corresponding ingress rules will be automatically generated.

If `loadBalancerSourceRanges` is not specified, incomig traffic to this service will be allowed for any source ip adresses.

## Configuration

Firewall Controller is configured with 2 CRDs: `firewalls.metal-stack.io` and `clusterwidenetworkpolicies.metal-stack.io`. Both are namespaced and must reside in the `firewall` namespace.
The `firewalls` CRD is typically written from the [gardener-extension-provider-metal](https://github.com/metal-stack/gardener-extension-provider-metal), the `clusterwidenetworkpolicy` should be provided by the deployment of your application.

Example Firewall CRD:

```yaml
apiVersion: metal-stack.io/v1
kind: Firewall
metadata:
  namespace: firewall
  name: firewall
spec:
  # Interval of reconcilation if nftables rules and network traffic accounting
  interval: 10s
  # Ratelimits specify on which physical interface, which maximum rate of traffic is allowed
  ratelimits:
  # The name of the interface visible with ip link show
  - interface: vrf104009
    # The maximum rate in MBits/s
    rate: 10
  # Internalprefixes defines a list of prefixes where the traffic going to, or comming from is considered internal, e.g. not leaving into external networks
  # given the archictecture picture above this would be:
  internalprefixes:
  - "1.2.3.0/24
  - "172.17.0.0/16"
  - "10.0.0.0/8"
```

Example ClusterwideNetworkPolicy:

```yaml
apiVersion: metal-stack.io/v1
kind: ClusterwideNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  namespace: firewall
  name: clusterwidenetworkpolicy-sample
spec:
  egress:
  - to:
    - cidr: 1.1.0.0/24
      except:
      - 1.1.1.0/16
    - cidr: 8.8.8.8/32
    ports:
    - protocol: UDP
      port: 53
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 53
```

## Status

Once the firewall-controller is running, it will report several statistics to the Firewall CRD Status:
This can be inspected by running:

```bash
kubectl describe -n firewall firewall
```

The output would look like:

```yaml

## Prometheus integration

There are two exporters running on the firewall to report essential metrics from this machine:

- node-exporter for machine specific metrics like cpu, ram and disk usage, see [node-exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter) for details.
- nftables-exporter for nftables metrics, see [nftables-exporter](https://github.com/Sheridan/nftables_exporter)

Both exporters are exposed as services:

```bash
kubectl get svc -n firewall
NAME                TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
nftables-exporter   ClusterIP   None         <none>        9630/TCP   13h
node-exporter       ClusterIP   None         <none>        9100/TCP   13h
```

These services are in front of virtual endpoints:

```bash
kubectl get ep -n firewall
NAME                ENDPOINTS         AGE
nftables-exporter   10.3.164.1:9630   13h
node-exporter       10.3.164.1:9100   13h
```

You can scrape these services in you prometheus installation to get the metrics.

To check you can run:

```bash
curl nftables-exporter.firewall.svc.cluster.local:9630/metrics
curl node-exporter.firewall.svc.cluster.local:9100/metrics
```

## Firewall Logs

It is also possible to tail for the dropped packets with the following command (install stern from [stern](https://github.com/wercker/stern) ):

```bash
stern -n firewall drop
```

The output will look like:

```json

You can forward the droptailer logs to any log aggregation infrastructure you have in place.
